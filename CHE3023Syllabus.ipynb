        "WHAT IF?  Is a question an engineer should never stop asking.  Any calculation worth doing once in a real engineering situation, is inevitably repeated over and over again for different conditions.  Coding to automate calculations is therefore one of the most valuable engineering skills.  We will use Python intensively in this class using Google's Colaboratory Jupyter Notebook environment.  It is highly recommended for you to go through the following free online texts to brush up on your Python skills BEFORE our first class:\n",

        "Grading in this course will try to reflect this reality as closely as possible.  There will be HW problems (10%) and also 3 Exams (30% each) that will involve submission of Youtube videos where you present (without looking at notes) solution to problems and write Python code (live) to complete the calculations.<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "You will have approximately 1 week to complete each of these multipart videos submitted as YouTube playlists that would average between 30 to 45 minutes long.  Do note that because you are presenting on camera and not allowed to look at notes while you present and write the code, it will take many attempts to make a video worthy of submission.  Make your first recording attempt no later than the 2nd day after the Exam is assigned.  It will be much harder than you think - do not procrastinate.\n"
